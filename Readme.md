##Things I need:
(Bugs go here)
- store paths in creep memory.
- Ramparts are not getting repaired.
- harvest creeps do not drop off the rest of the energy when they drop off a load.
- I want my workers to harvest from multiple sources.

##Things I want:

- [*done*] Body parts increase

- All creeps to report and alert to combat -- RED ALERT.

- *[done]* Builders prefer construction sites:
  - Defense first, mainly turrets.
  - Then Extensions for bigger creeps
  - Then roads and wall infrastructure.

- I want to define a worker role.

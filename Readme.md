##Things I need:
(Bugs go here)
  - store paths in creep memory.
  - Ramparts are not getting repaired.

##Things I want:

- All creeps to report and alert to combat -- RED ALERT.

- I want to define a flag that creeps go to wait at when there is no room at the energy node.

- Builders prefer construction sites:
  - Defense first, mainly turrets.
  - Then Extensions for bigger creeps
  - Then roads and wall infrastructure.

- I want to define a worker role.

##Things I need:

- *Bug* Issue with only one builder appearing should have max of three.
- *Bug* Issue with screeps dodging in and out around the energy node.

##Things I want:

- All creeps to report and alert to combat -- RED ALERT.

- I want to define a flag that creeps go to wait at when there is no room at the energy node.

- Builders prefer construction sites:
  - Defense first, mainly turrets.
  - Then Extensions for bigger creeps
  - Then roads and wall infrastructure.
